### Tell me about yourself

**1. A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.**

Hello World!

**2. A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?**

Helping the internet look a little nicer.

**3. Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.**

Hello! My name is Benjamin Rude and I have spent the over the last 10 years honing my skills as a customer service specialist. Someone who can interact with most all people in a variety of situations positive or negative. The most pride I have comes from the fact when I was a dock master for an Amazon corporate building I was informed by the client the property management I had single handedly saved my company the contract as I kept everything stable while the rest of my crew was always changing. I had to deal with outside contractors, amazon and property management staff daily. Now I have been trained in Software Development and I want to bring my skills new and old to your business.

**4. What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.**

You can be as creative as you want to be within the confines of the code. When you go to look up a problem you have 15 different people seemingly answering it 15 different ways.
